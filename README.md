- Hi, I am @git-djyk
- I am currently learning ... everything from scratch (npm and Node.js, GitHub, SourceTree, NextJS, React, React-DOM, Vercel, etc)
- Experience: JavaScript and ECMA Script for decades
- Progress: GitHub and SourceTree on PC are now successfully connected, ready to push/pull
-- tested: clone from a repository, make branch, merge branches to main, commit with comment, push only to branch
-- tested: rebase instead of merge, delete branch
