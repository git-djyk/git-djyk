- Hi, I am @git-djyk
- I am currently learning ... everything from scratch (npm and Node.js, GitHub, SourceTree, NextJS, React, React-DOM, Vercel, etc)
- Experience: JavaScript and ECMA Script for decades
- Progress: GitHub and SourceTree on PC are now successfully connected, ready to push/pull
-- tested: clone from a repository, make branch, merge branches to main, commit with comment, push only to branch
-- tested: rebase instead of merge, delete branch

-- tested: created a new repository "next", tried to push NextJS repo on local which has been built via npm w/ command "npm install --save next react react-dom"
-- issues: NextJS cannot be pushed from local to remote(GitHub) maybe because a file exceeds size limit(node_modules/@next/swc-win32-x64-msvc/next-swc.win32-x64-msvc.node 123MB).

-- tested: NextJS by GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages, but it failed w/ error "process completed with exit code 1". maybe because I still don't have overall and precise knowledge about everything
